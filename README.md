# Web-portal-for-Postgraduate-Students-UoS

Dr AHS Bukhari Post Graduate Center for Information and Communication Technology is a 
web-based portal which is mainly designed for the simplicity of M.Phil and PhD students, so 
they can easily check their results online when the instructor uploads, rather than getting it 
manually. It is helpful for both, the teacher, as well as students because it provides easiness to 
both.
It helps teacher in a way, that the teacher can easily add, update, and delete any record of student 
easily and there is negligible chance of redundancy and inaccuracy.
It is helpful for students, because they can easily check their results on their portal anywhere, 
without having to go to department or contacting teacher in this regard
